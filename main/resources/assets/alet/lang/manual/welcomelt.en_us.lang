manual.page={scale:2.0}{bold}LittleTiles{end}{newLines:2}   {key}LittleTiles{end} is a remarkable mod that has revolutionized Minecraft's voxel-based building. It was first unveiled in 2015, and since then, it has been a platform for players to build voxels that are 1/32nd the size of a vanilla block and even smaller if desired! CreativeMD, with the support of several other developers, have been the driving force behind LT's evolution. What began as a simple voxel mod has now transformed into a versatile tool that allows you to build with any sized {end}{ref:definingterms}Tiles{end}, slopes, and corner slopes. You can even create custom doors, ladders, beds, and more, making your Minecraft experience truly unique.{end}{newLines:2}{scale:2.0}{bold}Where To Report Issues{end}{newLines:2}   Github: {end}{url:"https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/issues"}https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/issues{end}{newLines:1}   Discord: {end}{url:"https://discord.com/invite/W9QM3fS"}#issues{end}{newLines:2}   For an example of how to make a report check out {end}{ref:reportissues}How To Report Issues{end}{newLines:2}{scale:2.0}{bold}How Can I Donate?{end}{newLines:2}   You can make donation at {end}{url:"https://www.patreon.com/creativemd"}CreativeMD's Patreon{end}.{end}
