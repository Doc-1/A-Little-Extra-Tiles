manual.page={scale:2.0}{bold}How To Report Issues{end}{newLines:2}   The information we need to help you solve your problem will depend on the type of issue you are having. You may encounter a bug, user error, or crash. If it is a user error but you are unsure, treat it as a bug, and we will be here to help you. If it is a crash, I hope you remember what you read here when it happens. Or, hopefully, you can at least open the manual without crashing. Well, it's not like this manual is necessary for reporting issues.{end}{newLines:2}{scale:2.0}{bold}Where To Report{end}{newLines:2}   For issues with LittleTiles click {end}{ref:welcomelt}Here{end}. For issues with ALET click {end}{ref:welcomealet}Here{end}. If you are unsure which one the issue is from, use either or and you will be directed to the correct source.{end}{newLines:2}{scale:2.0}{bold}Bug Report Example{end}{newLines:2}   If you believe you have found a bug, we need to know the versions, any other mods, the steps you took, and the unexpected, as well as the expected results. For example, say you are selecting the colors for the Little Paintbrush, but it only paints Tiles black. The following is what we would need to help. Pictures or videos with the same info will work the same.{end}{newLines:2}LittleTiles_v1.5.87{end}{newLines:1}CreativeCore_v1.10.71{end}{newLines:1}   Moving color sliders in the Little Paintbrush Gui and pressing Esc on my keyboard always paints the tiles black. Regardless of what Gui says the color sliders are set to. I expect the paintbrush to paint the tiles in the color I have selected in the Gui.{end}{newLines:2}{scale:2.0}{bold}Crash-Report Example{end}{newLines:2}   Like a bug report, a crash report requires us to know what you did before the crash. However, we will need a copy of the crash report and log. To find the crash report and log, {end}{url:"https://help.akliz.net/docs/find-minecraft-forge-logs"}Akliz{end} has lovely documentation on how to retrieve it. Please provide the entire crash report and log, and do not just copy "Error code: -1", as that provides no information and makes it difficult for us to diagnose the issue.{end}
