manual.page={scale:2.0}{bold}Draw Shapes{end}{scale:1.0}{color:-1}{newLines:2}    A {end}{key}Draw Shape{end}, is the form that the little tools' function will take. For instance, bellow in Figure 1, the default Draw Shape for the {end}{clickable}Little Chisel{end} is the {end}{clickable}Box{end}. The Draw Shape's function, depending on the tool, can remove, add or edit tiles. In addition, the {end}{clickable}Draw Mode{end} can change the functionallity of the tool's placement. We will go over that further later on. {end}{image:drawshapepre.png}{end}{center}Figure 1{end}
